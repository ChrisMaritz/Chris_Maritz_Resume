            <p class="bio">My name is Chris Maritz and ever since I can rememember i've always had a passion
                for creativity and problem solving. Initially my interests in this regard was 
                art but as many know the art industry is very tough to enter and next came agriculture.
            </p>
            <p class="bio">
                After experencing these two fields I was stuck I wanted to create like I do in art 
                and i wanted to solve problems as I did in Agriculture, One day I sat at decided I would try
                out the world of programming thus came in Web Developement into my life and as much as fed those
                needs it wasn't quite what I needed.
            </p>
            <p class="bio">
                With my interest still keen in the programming world but not web developement so to say I turned to Software
                Engineering and thus the true passion came about. Software Engineering has not just turned into a way to make
                money but it is a passion, the creativity, logic and problem solving that come with Software Engineering is a perfect
                combo for me and is something I aim to keep aiming higher goals for.
